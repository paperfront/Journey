# Journey
Repo for FBU Engineering final app

A self-help/guided-journaling app that will take you on a personal journey to self improvement.


## App Idea Brainstorming
Journey - A New Approach to Self Improvement
    - Start by outlining the traits you want to have/embody, and track your daily progress towards achieving those goals. Basically a journaling app that is focused on self improvement. For example, a trait the user could pick would be "Develop stronger relationships with my friends." To accomplish this, they will be taken through the following process:
        - What things do you currently do that prevent you from developing stronger bonds?
        - What things would someone do to develop stronger bonds?
        - What is a small and repeatable step you can take towards developing stronger bonds?
        - etc.
    - Basically, this would be a sort of template for self improvement. I could base the structure off of optimal techniques (will have to do more research).
