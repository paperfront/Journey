# Journey
Repo for FBU Engineering final app

A self-help/guided-journaling app that will take you on a personal journey to self improvement.


## App Idea Brainstorming
Journey - A New Approach to Self Improvement
    - Start by outlining the traits you want to have/embody, and track your daily progress towards achieving those goals. Basically a journaling app that is focused on self improvement. For example, a trait the user could pick would be "Develop stronger relationships with my friends." To accomplish this, they will be taken through the following process:
        - What things do you currently do that prevent you from developing stronger bonds?
        - What things would someone do to develop stronger bonds?
        - What is a small and repeatable step you can take towards developing stronger bonds?
        - etc.
    - Basically, this would be a sort of template for self improvement. I could base the structure off of optimal techniques (will have to do more research).

## Progress Outline

# Week 1
[ ] Create data models
[ ] Build skeleton views
[ ] Implement navigation between views + bottom navigation bar
[ ] Review and update project plan

# Week 2
[ ] Setup Firebase/Parse for user authentication
    [ ] Add sign-in with Google support
[ ] Setup SQLite DB for storage of journal entries locally
    [ ] Consider saving posts to Firebase/Parse as well for backup functionality/to allow users to have collaborative journal entries with their friends (this feature will not be implemented in the current outline, but could very well come to exist in the future so it could be nice to plan for it + make use of existing Firebase/Parse implementation)
[ ] Setup Google Maps SDK
[ ] Create functionality for making new journal entries with camera + geotags
[ ] Setup timeline fragment functionality

# Week 3
[ ] Visual polish
    [ ] Include an animation when signing in
[ ] Create analysis feature
[ ] Add gesture recognizer for favoriting entries by double tapping them
[ ] Add any extra journaling "tracks"

# Week 4
[ ] Add as many new tracks as desired
